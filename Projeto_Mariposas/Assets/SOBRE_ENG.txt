AboutText_01 /	Motenoia is the first game developed by the Aracnebula group as the Graduation Project of the Digital Games school, at Fatec SÃ£o Caetano do Sul.
AboutText_02 /	The concept of Motenoia consists in incorporating the subject of toxic relationships and their impact on intra and interpersonal relationships into a narrative-driven horror game, where the monsters constitute a metaphor to the damage caused by this kind of relationship.
AboutText_03 /	Motenoia explores themes such as the impact of misogyny and patriarchy on human relationships, the impact of abusive family relationships between parents on their children, the psychological impact of loss on the self and those closely related to them, and more.
AboutText_04 /	The cultural inspirations of Motenoia include brazilian, armenian and russian themes. The use of moths as allegories came from the brazilian superstition revolving the "mariposa bruxinha" (black witch moth) and the belief that these insects are a bad omen. The use of visual elements that resemble cross-stitch patterns in the pixel art came from the abundancy of this form of art in Armenian and Russian cultures. The use of Matryoshka dolls to represent the moth's Matriarch came from russian folklore, where these dolls are associated with motherhood, also serving as an allegory to the main character's situation, whose prospect of motherhood was lost.
