** ANOUSH E SARKIS - CHEGANDO NA CASA**

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]The moving company didn't even bother to bring the boxes inside...

[ID=ID_SARKIS]Not surprising at all. No one has rented this house in ages, the landlord probably didn't even believe someone was actually going to live here. Yet, it is a very beautiful house.

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]Still... Isn't there any reason why no one has lived here for so long?

[ID=ID_SARKIS]Probably due to the remote location, Anoush. But that doesn't matter; this isn't a summer camp, we're here to work. 

I have a few calls to make. Go and start organizing those boxes in the meantime.

[ENDQUEUE]

** IF: INTERAGIR COM SARKIS DURANTE O PUZZLE **

[ID=ID_SARKIS]I'm on the phone right now.

[ENDQUEUE]

** PUZZLE DAS CAIXAS: SALA **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]The realtor told us this house has been through renovations recently. It's not unusual to find empty paint cans such as this one.

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]Sarkis mentioned no one has rented this house in ages. I must admit this has me a bit uneasy.

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I miss the days when I would have people over for tea. I've been feeling quite lonely in the past few years.

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I miss going out with Sarkis and our friends. I wonder, would they still remember me?

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I like tending to plants when I feel lonely.

[ENDQUEUE]

** PUZZLE DAS CAIXAS: COZINHA **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]]Sometimes I wish Sarkis would help me in the kitchen. Making dinner is usually more fun with someone else to set the table.

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I always make Sarkis' favorite food, he really might as well wash the dishes sometimes, in return.

[ENDQUEUE]

** PUZZLE DAS CAIXAS: QUARTO **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]On one side, he snores, all carefree... On the other one, I suffer with intense nightmares and insomnia... Sometimes, it seems like we don't even sleep in the same bed.

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]At least I can sleep now, even if it's just a little bit.

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I miss painting on my free time. I was never really good, but it was a relaxing activity.

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]Sarkis and I went to a lot of concerts in the 2000s. I miss the times when we had fun together.

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I really miss this version of Sarkis...

[ENDQUEUE]

** PUZZLE DAS CAIXAS: BANHEIRO **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]Dr. Petrosyan prescribed me two pills in the morning and two at night, no more and no less... but I feel a lot better when I take them.

Maybe it wouldn't do much harm to take a few more every now and then...

[ENDQUEUE]

** PUZZLE DAS CAIXAS: ESCRITÓRIO **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I graduated with even higher grades than Sarkis, yet now he treats me like a reaserch assistant.

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I am glad for the success Sarkis achieved in all these years...

[ENDQUEUE]

** PUZZLE DAS CAIXAS: BEBÊ **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]It's too hard to even look...

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I can't go back there.

[ENDQUEUE]

** PUZZLE DAS CAIXAS: COMPLETO **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]Time to take my meds.

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]Would you look at that... Even here you'll show up.

[ENDQUEUE]

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]There's insecticide spray in here. Might be useful, but Sarkis is very allergic...

[ENDQUEUE]

** IF: USAR O INSETICIDA **

[ID=ID_SARKIS]Anoush… cough… did you use… cough… that poison… again?

[ENDQUEUE]

** IF: TENTAR ENTRAR NO ESCRITÓRIO **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I should prepare dinner before interrupting Sarkis.

[ENDQUEUE]

** JANTA FEITA - ANOUSH ENTRA NO ESCRITÓRIO **

[ID=ID_SARKIS]Just what I needed, damn it...

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]What happened?

[ID=ID_SARKIS]We have a problem with the samples. Apparently, they didn't send us any female specimens, only males.

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]What do you mean? There were over 30 samples and not even one female?

[ID=ID_SARKIS]I called the lab and they confirmed that there are only male samples.

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]That is too weird. They would have said something before! Maybe they didn't understand your question...

Maybe there are only male samples left because they sent us the only females?

Could it be that they were lost during transportation? But how could all the females just vanish?

Could it really be that they were never there to begin with?

[ID=ID_SARKIS]*Sigh*

Seems like it, Anoush. I meticulously reviewed all of the records and samples and there is no record of female moths. Acording to the records, they have never even got to the lab.

** OPÇÕES DE ESCOLHAS DE DIÁLOGO **

** OPÇÃO 1 **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]Did you check professor Grigorian's notes again? He was researching these moths until last year. Was there anything about females?

[ID=ID_SARKIS]I did, I did...

** OPÇÃO 2 **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]Do you think it's possible that the lab might have lost some of their records?

[ID=ID_SARKIS]Everything is possible! I don't know!

** OPÇÃO 3 **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]What do you think of this discrepancy?

[ID=ID_SARKIS]Don't know...

** OPÇÃO 4 **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I have a hypothesis. It might be a very blatant sexual dimorphism, similar to that of the humpback anglerfish, Melanocetus johnsonii.

The males are so different from the females that it took years to-

[ID=ID_SARKIS]Anoush, I know, I have a doctor's degree in biology, remember?

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I was just mentioning for the sake of comparison, sorry...

But... As you know, to this day, they could only obtain less than 10 male samples of that species, so-

[ID=ID_SARKIS]I have already considered this hypothesis, it was the first thing I thought of. We can't be sure yet. It's a complex situation, coming up with theories right now is useless.

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]Right...

** OPÇÃO 5 **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]What a pickle...

** Continuação do diálogo **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]Well. Don't you want to have dinner, then, and leave that for tomorrow?

[ID=ID_SARKIS]No... I'm not hungry... I'll be here a bit longer...

[ENDQUEUE]

** ANOUSH SAI DO ESCRITÓRIO **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]I'd better go to bed. I also lost my appetite.

** DIA 2: CASO PERGUNTE MAIS DA CASA **

[ID=ID_ANOUSH]A letter...? How odd...

[ENDQUEUE]
