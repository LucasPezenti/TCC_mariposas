MessageLine / 1 / Not surprising at all. No one has rented this house in ages, the landlord probably didn't even believe someone was actually going to live here.

MessageLine / 1 / Yet, it is a very beautiful house.

MessageLine / 0 / The only thing is... Isn't there any reason why no one has lived here for so long?

MessageLine / 1 / Probably due to the remote location, Anoush. But that doesn't matter; this isn't a summer camp, we're here to work.

MessageLine / 1 / I have a few calls to make. Go and start organizing those boxes in the meantime.

MessageLine / 0 / Just what I needed, damn it...

MessageLine / 1 / What happened?

MessageLine / 0 / We have a problem with the samples. Apparently, they didn't send us any female specimens, only males.

MessageLine / 1 / What do you mean? There were over 30 samples and not even one female?

MessageLine / 0 / I called the lab and they confirmed that there are only male samples.

MessageLine / 1 / That is too weird. They would have said something before! Maybe they didn't understand your question...

MessageLine / 1 / Maybe there are only male samples left because they sent us the only females?

MessageLine / 1 / Could it be that they were lost during transportation? But how could all the females just vanish?

MessageLine / 1 / Could it really be that they were never there to begin with?

MessageLine / 0 / *Sigh*

MessageLine / 0 / Seems like it, Anoush. I meticulously reviewed all of the records and samples and there is no record of female moths. Acording to the records, they have never even got to the lab.

MessageLine / 1 / Did you check professor Grigorian's notes again? He was researching these moths until last year. Was there anything about females?

MessageLine / 0 / I did, I did...

MessageLine / 1 / Do you think it's possible that the lab might have lost some of their records?

MessageLine / 0 / Everything is possible! I don't know!

MessageLine / 1 / Well... What do YOU think of this discrepancy?

MessageLine / 0 / Don't know...

MessageLine / 1 / I have a hypothesis. It might be a very blatant sexual dimorphism, similar to that of the humpback anglerfish, Melanocetus johnsonii.

MessageLine / 1 / The males are so different from the females that it took years to-

MessageLine / 0 / Anoush, I know, I have a doctor's degree in biology, remember?

MessageLine / 1 / I was just mentioning for the sake of comparison, sorry...

MessageLine / 1 / But... As you know, to this day, they could only obtain less than 10 male samples of that species, so-

MessageLine / 0 / I have already considered this hypothesis, it was the first thing I thought of. We can't be sure yet. It's a complex situation, coming up with theories right now is useless.

MessageLine / 1 / Right...

MessageLine / 1 / Well. Don't you want to have dinner, then, and leave that for tomorrow?

MessageLine / 0 / No... I'm not hungry... I'll be here a bit longer...
